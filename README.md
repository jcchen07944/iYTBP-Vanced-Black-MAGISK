# YouTube Vanced Universal Installer 
## By Xinto

Have you ever wonder why YouTube has so *MANY* ads?  
No?  
I wonder why lol  

Introducing The new Vanced installer! 

# Info
YouTube Vanced is a modified version of stock YT app with many features, such as:  
- Ad blocking  
- Background Playback  
- Customizations, Woooah  
- many other fun things!   

# Installer Changelog  
## v1.0  
- initial release  

# Vanced Changelog  
## v15.05.54  
- Fixed bugs that YT itself fixed  
- Fixed some bugs from Discord
- Auto subtitles have been replaced with live captions  
- accessibility seek buttons have been removed  
- auto repeat has been removed (will be fixed a bit later)

# WARNING
As of now, the module requires you to disable signature verification before flashing it, this is needed because Vanced doesn't have proper signature to pass Google Play Services verification without crashing   
If I (or Vanced Team) somehow finds a way to bypass this, or even make the module disable verification temporarily, a fix will be pushed asap.  
If the app doesnt appear in Launcher, it means you didn't disable signature verification. please remove the module, disable verification, reflash the module and restart, if app appears in launcher, you can safely re-enable signature verification
